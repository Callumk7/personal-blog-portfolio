As a computer scientist pursuing a PhD in systems engineering, I have been
exploring the performance of different programming languages and engines.
Recently, I have been comparing the V8 engine used in Google Chrome with Rust
engine used in Deno.

V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome and Node.js. It
is known for its speed and efficiency in executing JavaScript code. On the other
hand, Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built on the Rust
programming language. It aims to provide a more secure and reliable environment
for running JavaScript code.

One of the key differences between V8 and Rust is their memory management. V8
uses a garbage collector to manage memory, which can lead to performance issues
when dealing with large amounts of data. Rust, on the other hand, uses a system
of ownership and borrowing to manage memory, which allows for more efficient
memory usage and better performance.

In a blog post by Ryan Dahl, the creator of Deno, he explains the advantages of
using Rust for building a JavaScript runtime:

> "Rust's performance characteristics are well-suited for a language runtime.
> Rust is a compiled language with a focus on low-level control and predictable
> performance. Rust's memory safety guarantees and its ownership model make it
> possible to eliminate entire classes of bugs that plague other systems
> languages."

Furthermore, a benchmark test conducted by the Deno team showed that Deno's Rust
engine outperformed Node.js and V8 in several areas, including file I/O and HTTP
requests. This suggests that Rust's memory management and performance
optimizations can provide significant benefits for JavaScript runtimes.

However, it is important to note that V8 has a long history of development and
optimization, and it is still widely used in many applications and systems. As
stated in a blog post by the V8 team:

> "V8 has been optimized for a wide range of JavaScript workloads, from small
> scripts to large-scale web applications. We continue to invest in improving
> the performance and stability of V8 to ensure that it remains the best choice
> for JavaScript execution."

In conclusion, while both V8 and Rust have their strengths and weaknesses,
Rust's memory management and performance optimizations can provide significant
benefits for building JavaScript runtimes. As the field of systems engineering
continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these technologies are
further developed and applied in real-world applications.
